# The Tech Academy's C# Programs!
Discover a collection of my small projects highlighting my skills in fundamental C# and .NET Framework. This repository encompasses the following projects:

1. [Twenty-One-Casino-Game]([https://github.com/psalazar5/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic_C%23_Programs/TwentyOne](https://github.com/psalazar5/TheTechAcademyCSharpPrograms/tree/main/Basic_C%23_Programs/TwentyOneGame)) - A web application based on the game of blackjack. It utilizes classes, loops, methods, and branching statements to create a fully functional console application, demonstrating the application of C# concepts in real-world scenarios.

2. [Car-Insurance-Project](https://github.com/psalazar5/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic_C%23_Programs/CarInsurance) - An MVC web application that simulates a car insurance website. Users can input policy information, and the application calculates a quote based on business logic. It utilizes home and insuree controllers, model binding, and action methods to create, edit, and delete records. The project also incorporates real-world logic to enable users to check out details and manage their policy data effectively.
   
3. [News-Letter-MVC](https://github.com/psalazar5/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic_C%23_Programs/WebApplicationMVC) -  An MVC web app highlighting the power of model-view-controller concepts. Users can sign up for the newsletter application by providing contact information, which is stored in an SQL database. The project showcases seamless integration between the web application and the database, demonstrating my ability to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

These projects reflect my learning journey in the course, combining various C# concepts and techniques to create functional applications. Each project showcases my ability to apply programming logic, model binding, and database integration effectively, underscoring my versatility as a C# developer.

## Downloading these projects to your machine in VS 2019:
